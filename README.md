# quiz
A C quiz coding program is a small interactive software where users can answer multiple-choice questions related to C programming. The program typically displays a question, then presents a list of possible answers. The user selects an answer, and the program checks if it is correct, providing feedback. It may also keep track of the score and present additional questions until the quiz is finished. This helps users to test and improve their C programming knowledge in an engaging way.
